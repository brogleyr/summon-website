### First Off...

Hello. Welcome to the notebook. I intend to record the status and development of my craft here.

### On the creation of new pages

Crafting a website from scratch has proven arduous. I've thus written a script that will create a new page for the website in one command, wholly formed.

I wrote my script in Python using the Beautiful Soup library, which allows me to easily reference and modify the contents of html trees. The python script opens an html template, replaces a few values based on the name of the page, and creates a new html file.

### On the maintenance of markdown

I've also started writing the text for my markdown files in a dedicated markdown editor. This will hopefully allow me to emphasize getting content onto the page with little friction.

### There is more to come

As it stands right now, I have a large personal collection of digital artifacts and experiments that I want to share. Hopefully I've removed enough friction from my process today that progress on this site will come more quickly in the coming weeks.
