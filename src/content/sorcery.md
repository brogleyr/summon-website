## What is this sorcery?

All summoning begins and ends in the mind. For creation to be realized, it must be envisioned, enacted, and interpreted.

There are many channels from mind to matter to mind again. One is written language, another is the web. So here we are, in this place together.

I have made this place visible and you have asked to see it. We have summoned each other.

## The Web

In the world that I am from, people practice all different kinds of sorceries using the web. It's proven to be a most powerful medium.

And so I want to channel it. To shape it. To imbue it with a piece of myself.

I come from a time when the flow of the web was expanding. When it felt like all prior limits on human connection were bursting at the seams. 

I think it was a kind of love. 
## Love

Let this place be a site of that unseen force.

A place for me to pour.

And a place for you to drink.
